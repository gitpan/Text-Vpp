This is the README file for Text::Vpp, the Perl versatile pre-prosessor.

You may find this module useful if you want to pre-preprocess text. 
Vpp understands if, else, elsif, endif, include and can substitute variables
in the text. (See the test files in the distribution)

This module is now in BETA state

This mopule was written with perl5.003. It should work fine with perl5.001
or later (although I did not test it).

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

BETA exit criteria:
- When some peoples (well, say 10 guys) tell me that they've used it 
  and did not find major bug with the module or minor problems with the 
  interface.

Finally, I'd like to thank Helmut Jarausch for his bug report and the patch
he provided.
